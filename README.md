# Demoing some Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## UsersSlice

The usersSlice fetches 10 users from the jsonplaceholder api with a thunk and stores them in the usersstore. The usersSlice has an addUser method to, well, add a user!

## Users component

Get users from the store and displays them in a list.
